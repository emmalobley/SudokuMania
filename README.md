Final project for the CFGDegree

# Initial Ideas

We started out by brainstorming what we all enjoyed and discussed making some sort of puzzle game. We found an API which generates sudoku grids and solutions of varying difficulty.

Upon reviewing the API we discussed user interaction to select sudoku difficulty and the option of having a running timer.
